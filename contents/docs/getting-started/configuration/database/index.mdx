Before running the project, you need to ensure your database is properly configured.

## Configuring database

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Go to your Supabase Dashboard">

  ```plaintext
  https://supabase.com/dashboard
  ```
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Navigate to SQL Editor">
This is where you can run SQL scripts to create tables, functions, and more.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Run the SQL file">

  The file provided in the `/supabase/migrations/001_create_tables.sql` path.

This file includes the full schema for NeoSaaS â€” tables for users, subscriptions, customers, and other core features.
