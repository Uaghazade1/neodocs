  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Go to Vercel">
    Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and log in with your account. If you don't have one, create a new account.  
    Click on **"Add New Project"** from your dashboard.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Import the GitHub Repository">
    From the project list, select the **NeoSaaS GitHub repository** you received access to.  
    Click **"Import"** and proceed to the next step.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Configure Environment Variables">
    Vercel will ask for environment variables during setup.  
    Use the values from the `.env` file in the repository and paste them accordingly into Vercel.  
    Be sure to include keys like:
    
    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
    SUPABASE_URL=
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
    ```

    You can always update these later from the **Settings â†’ Environment Variables** tab in your Vercel dashboard.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Deploy the Project">
    Once the environment variables are set, click **"Deploy"**.  
    Vercel will automatically install dependencies, build the project, and host it under a vercel.app domain.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 5: Set a Custom Domain (Optional)">
    If you want to connect a custom domain, go to the **Domains** tab and follow the instructions to link your domain name.
